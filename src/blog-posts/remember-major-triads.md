Use these 7 words to instantly recall any major triad (Root–3rd–5th):

| Root | Word | Triad |
|------|------|-------|
| A | **A**C**C**E**n**t | A–C#–E |
| B | **B**iD**D**e**F**ord**S** | B–D#–F# |
| C | **C**E**i**lin**G** | C–E–G |
| D | **D**u**FF**m**A**n | D–F#–A |
| E | **E**G**G**Bo**x** | E–G#–B |
| F | **F**A**C**e | F–A–C |
| G | **G**ar**B**e**D** | G–B–D |

### The Rules

1. **Letters give Root → 3rd → 5th** (in order)
2. **Double letter = sharp** (CC = C#, DD = D#, FF = F#, GG = G#)
3. **Only B:** final S = F# (sharp 5th)
4. **Bonus:** 3rd → Root = 6th, 5th → Root = 4th

That's it. Seven words, all twelve notes covered.
