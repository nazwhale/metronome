title: "iPhone Metronome Not Playing? Check Your Silent Switch"

If you're using an online metronome on your iPhone and hearing nothing, don't worry—you're not alone. This is one of the most common issues iPhone users encounter with web-based audio apps, and the fix is usually simple.

### The Culprit: Silent Mode

iPhones have a physical switch (or button, on newer models) that controls silent mode. When your phone is in silent mode, web audio—including metronome clicks—won't play through your speakers.

This catches many users off guard because:
- Other sounds like alarms and timers still work
- Music apps often bypass silent mode
- The metronome works fine with headphones connected

But web-based audio follows different rules and respects the silent switch.

### How to Fix It

The solution is simple: take your iPhone off silent mode. Here's how, depending on your model:

#### iPhone 15 Pro, 15 Pro Max, 16, and newer (Action Button)

These models replaced the traditional silent switch with a programmable Action Button.

1. By default, the Action Button controls silent mode
2. Press it briefly to toggle between silent and ring mode
3. You'll see a banner at the top of your screen showing the current mode
4. Make sure it shows the **bell icon** (not the crossed-out bell)

If you've customized your Action Button for something else:
1. Go to **Settings > Action Button**
2. Select **Silent Mode** to restore the default behavior
3. Or, go to **Settings > Sounds & Haptics** and toggle off **Silent Mode**

#### iPhone 14 and earlier (Physical Switch)

These models have a small switch on the left side of the phone, above the volume buttons.

1. Look at the switch on the left edge of your iPhone
2. If you see **orange**, your phone is in silent mode
3. Flip the switch toward the screen (away from the back) to turn off silent mode
4. The orange indicator should no longer be visible

### Quick Reference by Model

| iPhone Model | Silent Control Location |
|-------------|------------------------|
| iPhone 16 Pro / Pro Max | Action Button (left side, above volume) |
| iPhone 16 / 16 Plus | Action Button |
| iPhone 15 Pro / Pro Max | Action Button |
| iPhone 15 / 15 Plus | Physical switch (left side) |
| iPhone 14 (all models) | Physical switch |
| iPhone 13 (all models) | Physical switch |
| iPhone 12 (all models) | Physical switch |
| iPhone SE | Physical switch |

### Why Headphones Work Regardless

If you've noticed the metronome works fine with AirPods or Bluetooth headphones even when the silent switch is on—that's expected behavior. iOS treats headphone audio differently from speaker audio. The silent switch only affects the built-in speakers.

This means if you're practicing somewhere you need to be quiet anyway, just connect headphones and you won't need to worry about the switch.

### Still No Sound?

If toggling silent mode doesn't help, try these additional steps:

1. **Check the volume** - Press the volume up button to make sure it's not at zero
2. **Refresh the page** - Sometimes web audio needs a fresh start
3. **Tap the play button again** - iOS requires a user interaction to start audio
4. **Check Do Not Disturb** - While this shouldn't affect web audio, it's worth checking
5. **Close and reopen Safari** - This clears any stuck audio contexts

### Why Does This Happen?

Apple designed iOS to respect user preferences about sound. When you flip that silent switch, you're telling your phone "I don't want unexpected sounds right now." Web browsers honor this by muting web audio.

Native apps can request permission to play audio regardless of the silent switch (which is why Spotify and Apple Music work), but web apps like online metronomes follow the stricter default behavior.

### Practice Tip

If you frequently forget to check your silent switch, consider making it part of your practice setup routine: tune your instrument, check your phone's silent switch, set your tempo, and start practicing.
